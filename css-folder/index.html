            MKBHD is one my favorite YouTubers. He makes technology videos. Although he is more mainstream compared to some other tech reviewers, he makes some pretty in depth reviews, from phones to camera lens such as the video showed above. I like to watch him, since I like to see his improvement. I remember, when he first started, he simply recorded himself. Now, it is clear his editing and cinematography skills have improved so much.

            Some of his other side projects, such as Auto Focus, or his Interviews, bring out the tech of cars and people in that order. He has reviewed Teslas, Lambos, and he has even interviewed Elon Musk!
